	<p>Hi my name is Tomasz. I'm currently a CUNY BA student studying game art and animation. I enjoy creating concept art, sprite art/animations, and low-poly 3D.</p>
	<p>When it comes to media, I appreciate the kind that get really weird with their world and presentation, but can still stick to delivering down to earth themes and messages. I especially enjoy media that subverts it's medium/genre's expectations and takes advantage of itself to tell touching stories. I hope to someday create game experiences like that.</p>
	<p>Currently during the school year I do freelance work for smaller teams and projects. This coming summer I'll be working at a local indie studio as an art intern. For the next year I plan to continue developing my art and skills, and hope to find part or full time work as a game artist.</p>
